# Home.co.uk — Pitch Deck (one-page)

This folder contains a one-page pitch-deck style website scaffold. Use it to present the slides from your `Home.co.uk.pptx` presentation.

Files:

- `index.html` — the one-page pitch deck with hero, problem, solution, metrics, team, contact.
- `styles.css` — styling to give a clean blue-accent deck look.
- `script.js` — simple navigation (prev/next, arrow keys) and contact demo.
- `assets/logo.svg` — placeholder logo.

How to use:

1. Copy images and slide text from your PPTX into the relevant sections in `index.html`.
2. Replace `assets/logo.svg` with the official Home.co.uk logo if you have it.
3. Open `index.html` in the browser to preview.

If you want, I can:

- Extract the PPTX content into these sections (please upload the `Home.co.uk.pptx` file here), or
- Improve styling to more precisely match Home.co.uk once you provide brand colors and assets.
